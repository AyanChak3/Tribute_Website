                <p><b>Sachin Tendulkar,</b> widely regarded as one of the greatest cricketers of all time, is a former Indian
                    cricketer who made an immense impact on the sport. Known as the "Master Blaster," he holds numerous
                    records, including being the first player to score 100 international centuries and the highest run-scorer
                    in both Test and One Day International cricket. Tendulkar's career spanned over two decades, from 1989 to 2013,
                    during which he became a national hero and a symbol of cricketing excellence. His dedication, humility, and
                    skill earned him respect worldwide, and he remains a legendary figure in Indian sports history.
